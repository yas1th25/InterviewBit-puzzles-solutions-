Consider a rectangular cake with a rectangular section (of any size or orientation) removed from it.
Is it possible to divide the cake exactly in half with only one cut?


solution approch is ::what does every line that cuts a rectangle in half have in common (something simple) ?
the correct answer is ::Option D...!

approach?
Every line that cuts a rectangle in half passes through the center of the rectangle. 
There are infinite such lines for every rectangle.
However, there is exactly one line that passes through the centers of both rectangles, the cake and the hole in it â€“ 
that is, of course, unless they share a common center. This line divides both rectangles exactly in half, and this is the line along which you make the cut. 
Hence, its always possible.
